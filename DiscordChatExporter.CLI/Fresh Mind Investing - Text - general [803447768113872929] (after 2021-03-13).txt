@Joyce... a humble suggestion at the start of every video put in writing (like the writing method Joyce uses in every every video) that it is not a financial advice, own personal opinion, do own due diligence, bla bla bla... 

To 100% make sure people not able to find any sort of issues...

She puts a disclaimer in the description


[13-Mar-21 02:49 PM] notroksci#9323
Its a little depressing that we even need disclaimers. I like Kenans one -  'cant stand the heat?' ... basically go away and invest in index funds. 😆

I wouldn’t go near his recommendations with a 10 foot pole haha. I watched one of his video, and his analysis is rattling off consensus price targets. Surely not...


[14-Mar-21 12:29 AM] eden#6732
For me, I quite like Goev’s vehicle. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/11/cars/canoo-electric-pickup-truck/index.html

😜  I wouldnt follow his advice nor any others - purely entertainment but I like his energy and earnestness.  I follow a lot of the YouTube "gurus" good to see what stocks are making noise - but they all talk about the same ones, echo chamber - prob watch each others videos.

Yes, there are very few youtubers that actually know what they are recommending and back it up with good analysis. @Joyce’s analysis compelled me to start a Patreon and Discord account, so that says a lot haha. Kenan... it’s “for entertainment purposes only” lol 😉
