I bought sens when it hit around 2.40


[13-Mar-21 12:00 AM] Ryukk#6455
using the fibonacci retracement


[13-Mar-21 12:01 AM] Ryukk#6455
the MACD was curling and RSI was oversold at 31 at time of purchase


[13-Mar-21 12:02 AM] Ryukk#6455
I saw a descending wedge forming but TBH alot of stocks were looking similar with this correction


[13-Mar-21 12:04 AM] Tom A#1892
Good charting and trade.  I picked up JMIA and a couple that day as well.  Missed this one.


[13-Mar-21 12:05 AM] Ryukk#6455
a penny stock im considering at this time is CTREM


[13-Mar-21 12:05 AM] Ryukk#6455
CTRM

[13-Mar-21 12:05 AM] Ryukk#6455
im waiting for an entry around 0.85


[13-Mar-21 12:06 AM] dogg#3367
Same that would be my first entry point if it comes down


[13-Mar-21 12:07 AM] Ryukk#6455
the fundamentals look ok


[13-Mar-21 12:07 AM] Ryukk#6455
and the need fore dry bulk materials aka rare earth materials for EV products makes sense


[13-Mar-21 12:08 AM] Player13#9784
i dont get the hype of CTRM. they are a new company buying old ships in a space that already has shipping companies

[13-Mar-21 12:08 AM] Ryukk#6455
they have also been acquiring ships that were primarily focused on oil shipping that went out of business


[13-Mar-21 12:08 AM] Ryukk#6455
expanding their fleet


[13-Mar-21 12:08 AM] Player13#9784
arent shipping fleets like a dime a dozen. i get that institutional investors are putting money on this one, and one can follow the money so to speak


[13-Mar-21 12:08 AM] Ryukk#6455
It is a highly speculative stock


[13-Mar-21 12:09 AM] Player13#9784
but outside of that


[13-Mar-21 12:09 AM] Ryukk#6455
but it seems the safest to me out of SNDL, ZOM, etc


[13-Mar-21 12:09 AM] Player13#9784
fair. i guess im just at my fill of speculative. gimme my mj retail plays. theyre speculative but already profitable tyvm


[13-Mar-21 12:09 AM] Ryukk#6455
I do like the idea of playing ZOM prior to their launch of truforma though


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Player13#9784
HITIF is profitable and 60c a share


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Player13#9784
its too bad Charlie doesnt cover OTCs cause this one is just OTC cause its a canadian stock


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Ryukk#6455
the only cannabis stock im invested in currently is Planet 13


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Player13#9784
i love Planet 13


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Player13#9784
the price is a bit high already


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Ryukk#6455
alot of potential there


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Player13#9784
but i bought the dip on their warrants last week


[13-Mar-21 12:10 AM] Player13#9784
yea


[13-Mar-21 12:11 AM] Ryukk#6455
the middle man of cannabis while providing attractions


[13-Mar-21 12:11 AM] Player13#9784
they have an aggressive expansion plan. a successful model. they were able to pivot profitably with covid


[13-Mar-21 12:11 AM] Tom A#1892
It might be off to the races.  .85 is for sure resistance.  Violated it to fill the gap and touch the 50 day, but it has settled nicely and looks technically strong at the moment. If it turns around at 1.06 or 1.12 I could see it making another trip down to the 50 possibly if the rest of the market rolls over.


[13-Mar-21 12:11 AM] Player13#9784
i love that tourist trap cannabis park concept


[13-Mar-21 12:11 AM] Ryukk#6455
Ill consider buying CTRM around .90


[13-Mar-21 12:11 AM] Ryukk#6455
but .85 would be ideal


[13-Mar-21 12:12 AM] Player13#9784
in a space where theres a dime a dozen cannabis retailers, the ones to bet on are the oens that differentiate


[13-Mar-21 12:12 AM] Ryukk#6455
I still prefer putting money into other spec growth stocks like NIO, PLTR, and DKNG


[13-Mar-21 12:12 AM] Player13#9784
High Tide does ecom and accessories mfg/distribution


[13-Mar-21 12:12 AM] Player13#9784
i like PLTR


[13-Mar-21 12:12 AM] Player13#9784
GNOG will be my budget DKNG


[13-Mar-21 12:13 AM] Ryukk#6455
online gambling should support the government in creating tax revenue and creating jobs


[13-Mar-21 12:13 AM] Ryukk#6455
I belive its much safer than cannabis


[13-Mar-21 12:13 AM] Player13#9784
cannabis creates tax revenue. but its a longer play than online gambling


[13-Mar-21 12:13 AM] Ryukk#6455
true


[13-Mar-21 12:14 AM] Player13#9784
cannabis = political (decriminalization), virtue signaling for policy makers, and new sources or revenue


[13-Mar-21 12:14 AM] Ryukk#6455
If there is a cannabis stock id invest in other than planet 13


[13-Mar-21 12:14 AM] Ryukk#6455
it would be Aphria


[13-Mar-21 12:14 AM] Player13#9784
it will piggy back off the energy of BLM last year


[13-Mar-21 12:15 AM] Player13#9784
i havent paid attention to the growers


[13-Mar-21 12:15 AM] Ryukk#6455
Aphria is talks with Tilray for a merger


[13-Mar-21 12:15 AM] Ryukk#6455
Aphria stocks would be converted to Tilray stock at a 80% ratio I believe


[13-Mar-21 12:15 AM] Player13#9784
as a canadian, it concerns me that the canadian LPs are all operating at losses while the US MSOs are profitable


[13-Mar-21 12:16 AM] Player13#9784
i think the valuation of growers already has the value sunk in


[13-Mar-21 12:16 AM] Player13#9784
theyre trading at 20x 30x of sales/earnings already


[13-Mar-21 12:16 AM] Ryukk#6455
so if you bought apha now at 20


[13-Mar-21 12:16 AM] Player13#9784
thats why im going for the middle men


[13-Mar-21 12:16 AM] Ryukk#6455
tilray is at 27.57


[13-Mar-21 12:16 AM] Ryukk#6455
27.57 x 0.9 = 22


[13-Mar-21 12:16 AM] Ryukk#6455
0.8*


[13-Mar-21 12:17 AM] Player13#9784
its fair but as we get closer to the merger, the two prices will gravitate towards their respective ratios


[13-Mar-21 12:17 AM] Player13#9784
id rather just buy a stock i can 30% on


[13-Mar-21 12:17 AM] Ryukk#6455
which makes sense to get on soon


[13-Mar-21 12:17 AM] Ryukk#6455
but yeah im not sure if im ready to put more money in cannabis stocks


[13-Mar-21 12:17 AM] Player13#9784
people have known about it. now isnt soon anymore i dont think


[13-Mar-21 12:17 AM] Player13#9784
i dont blame you


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Ryukk#6455
im actually looking more into certain SPAC stocks


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Player13#9784
im the type to diversify but ive put way too much of my portfolio on the 2 MJ plays


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Ryukk#6455
FRX, SFTW, IPOE, ACIC, ACTC


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Player13#9784
banking on them to bring to 5 figures tho


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Player13#9784
it really is take your pick


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Player13#9784
i like AONE


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Player13#9784
its low to the floor and we know the merger target


[13-Mar-21 12:18 AM] Ryukk#6455
I also like aone but have exposure to NNDM currently


[13-Mar-21 12:19 AM] Ryukk#6455
for 3D printing


[13-Mar-21 12:19 AM] Player13#9784
i sold my sleepy spacs cause they werent doing anything. GME made me back my losses from selling the SPACs at 15% under


[13-Mar-21 12:19 AM] Ryukk#6455
I personally dont like doubling down on a certain sector


[13-Mar-21 12:19 AM] Ryukk#6455
unless its TSLA and NIO


[13-Mar-21 12:20 AM] Player13#9784
i think TSLA and NIO are too far out for me to invest money into. again, i feel like the valuation of tesla is too high for what it does rn


[13-Mar-21 12:20 AM] Player13#9784
we saw what happened to the price on a 3 week downward trend.


[13-Mar-21 12:20 AM] Player13#9784
when the actual crash hits, these stocks will deflate


[13-Mar-21 12:20 AM] Player13#9784
then ill buy


[13-Mar-21 12:20 AM] Ryukk#6455
yeah its hard to evaluate growth stocks on FA


[13-Mar-21 12:20 AM] Player13#9784
when tesla is 200 range


[13-Mar-21 12:21 AM] Player13#9784
i agree with that, but also when the market is in full bear mode, people will sell the stocks they cant FA


[13-Mar-21 12:21 AM] Ryukk#6455
But they have already established themselves as the leaders of EV


[13-Mar-21 12:21 AM] Player13#9784
it literally happened over the last 3 weeks


[13-Mar-21 12:21 AM] Ryukk#6455
yeah its been rough


[13-Mar-21 12:21 AM] Player13#9784
but they still have to compete against the big 3 auto mfgs with their fake EVs


[13-Mar-21 12:22 AM] Ryukk#6455
but I got into TSLA pretty early and have no plans of letting go


[13-Mar-21 12:22 AM] Player13#9784
i think its a bad gamble to think the big 3 arent going to fight for their share and play dirty


[13-Mar-21 12:22 AM] Player13#9784
oh thats good then


[13-Mar-21 12:22 AM] Player13#9784
im just shaking my head at anyone buying TSLA over 400


[13-Mar-21 12:22 AM] Player13#9784
its the same as betting on the top of a run


[13-Mar-21 12:22 AM] Ryukk#6455
dont get me wrong lol I would for sure throw a paycheck at TSLA around 550

ttty 

[13-Mar-21 12:23 AM] Player13#9784
im bullish on their autonomous truck play


[13-Mar-21 12:23 AM] Player13#9784
THAT is a game changer


[13-Mar-21 12:23 AM] weijie_1990#1135

[13-Mar-21 12:24 AM] Player13#9784
but i truly believe that this bubble a lot of people are afraid if, whether its this year or next, it will pop all these next gen plays something fierce. people who say the dotcom bubble said 80% drops


[13-Mar-21 12:24 AM] Player13#9784
maybe less this time around


[13-Mar-21 12:24 AM] Player13#9784
since some of these plays are solid to begin with


[13-Mar-21 12:24 AM] Ryukk#6455
Im on the side that we rent ready for the internet back then


[13-Mar-21 12:24 AM] Ryukk#6455
werent*


[13-Mar-21 12:25 AM] Player13#9784
but even a 50-60% dip on tesla would make me actually want to invest


[13-Mar-21 12:25 AM] Player13#9784
cause if my money is gonna wait for 5 years to double then i can put it somewhere better


[13-Mar-21 12:25 AM] Ryukk#6455
I would look into NIO to get involved in EV if you wanted to get started


[13-Mar-21 12:25 AM] Player13#9784
i dont mind it


[13-Mar-21 12:26 AM] Ryukk#6455
the infastructure China has made using Tesla has set a stage for NIO to flourish


[13-Mar-21 12:26 AM] Player13#9784
im just in small account mode so im very picky with my plays. spent the last 2 months learning trading having my hand in too many jars


[13-Mar-21 12:26 AM] Player13#9784
nice


[13-Mar-21 12:26 AM] Ryukk#6455
that and the fact that it cost 14k to have a license to operate a gasoline vehicle makes my mouth water


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Ryukk#6455
in china


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Player13#9784
hmm is that in Cali or


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Player13#9784
ah


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Player13#9784
love the mainland for their aggressive practices


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Ryukk#6455
they will be banning purchase of gasoline operated car by 2035


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Player13#9784
ok im sold lol


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Ryukk#6455
yeah ive been deep diving NIO lately


[13-Mar-21 12:27 AM] Ryukk#6455

[13-Mar-21 12:28 AM] Player13#9784

[13-Mar-21 12:28 AM] lostinlakebalboa#6782
Nio is a longer play anyhow


[13-Mar-21 12:29 AM] Player13#9784
$3 range is super speculative


[13-Mar-21 12:29 AM] lostinlakebalboa#6782
Even if it reaches a fraction of Tesla


[13-Mar-21 12:29 AM] lostinlakebalboa#6782
I also hold Fsr


[13-Mar-21 12:29 AM] Player13#9784
itll be the dominant force in asia and thats all i need it to be for me


[13-Mar-21 12:29 AM] Ryukk#6455
yeah thats what I thought when they were comparing a $3 company to TSLA

3 ecom sites positioned in EU and US


[13-Mar-21 12:46 AM] Player13#9784
they mfg 75% of the weed accessories they sell, at 50% margins


[13-Mar-21 12:46 AM] Player13#9784
and sell those accessories to competitor retail


[13-Mar-21 12:47 AM] Player13#9784
and they can do those things because they have been aggressively pursuing celebrity potheads for licensed accessory merch


[13-Mar-21 12:47 AM] Player13#9784
and theyre trading for 60c on OTC (80c on the Canadian exchange)

the reason why they‚Äôre still undervalued at 5 is because they don‚Äôt have exposure and they‚Äôre not on the american exchange yet. they applied for it recently tho

If bitcoin stays where it's at sos will be a good play. Riot and mara don't have much upside now.

[13-Mar-21 06:45 AM] tomS777#8077
I don‚Äôt ... it had a massive jump on Friday that ended in candle with long wix kinda like a hammer ... the panic of a 1.6 yield is already priced in


[13-Mar-21 06:47 AM] giod#5091
Some analyst saying they expect it to go to 2%

Anyone awake?


[13-Mar-21 06:49 AM] tomS777#8077
It just might , but the overall thing you have to remember here is that even 2 isn‚Äôt a bad thing for it self on contrary it‚Äôs actually good for the economy. The cause of the volatility is the rate in which it rises


[13-Mar-21 07:02 AM] giod#5091

[13-Mar-21 07:36 AM] Jimmy D#5438
Thats a tough call because BTC is running wild and that may keep the dip from actually happening

The premiums are beautiful


[13-Mar-21 07:37 AM] Jimmy D#5438
Why dont you sell a cash secured PUT instead?


[13-Mar-21 07:38 AM] Jimmy D#5438
This way you can get the stock at the price of your chosing if it drops


[13-Mar-21 07:38 AM] Jimmy D#5438
You get good money either way


[13-Mar-21 07:39 AM] TraderAddict#9573
Yea I was debating that


[13-Mar-21 07:39 AM] TraderAddict#9573
If the stock decreases does the premiums go up higher for puts?


[13-Mar-21 07:40 AM] CaneDawg#4435

[13-Mar-21 07:40 AM] Jimmy D#5438
What?


[13-Mar-21 07:42 AM] CaneDawg#4435
Never sold a put, u have the options to buy 100, instead of the call where u sell 100 if it reaches strike price?


[13-Mar-21 07:42 AM] TraderAddict#9573
I was thinking.. if RIOT did have a really red day while holding I could just buy a put to offer some protection or just buy the dip and average down and swing trade some shares while holding long and sell high.


[13-Mar-21 07:44 AM] Jimmy D#5438
So what you do is sell a PUT at the strike price you would be willing to buy the stock at.  Your broker will hold that amount of money until the option expires.  If it expires INT you will own the 100 shares of that stock.  If it expires OTM you would have your money released back to you.  You keep the premium either way.


[13-Mar-21 07:44 AM] Jimmy D#5438
This is the best way to own a stock at the price you feel comfortable with


[13-Mar-21 07:45 AM] CaneDawg#4435
Great, thx for the suggestion


[13-Mar-21 07:45 AM] Jimmy D#5438
So if you pick a $50 strike, you would need to have $5000 in your account


[13-Mar-21 07:46 AM] Jimmy D#5438
Once you own the shares you can start selling covered calls if you want.  This is called the wheel strategy.


[13-Mar-21 07:47 AM] CaneDawg#4435
Sounds like a good strat, make extra money before and after owning.

[13-Mar-21 08:53 AM] Player13#9784
i think its a gamble to buy a shorted stock's dip unless you already know the company, did DD, and were waiting for a dip. the road to recovery even on a good play can be a long one. Just look at CLOV
Market sentiment can be hard to change and take long. Thats why shorting is so effective, sadly


[13-Mar-21 08:53 AM] Player13#9784

[13-Mar-21 09:23 AM] Player13#9784
as a newbie, keep in mind people will be shouting tickers and there'll be hype. but we are all playing different plays, so try not to get caught up

some people take 5 minute positions. others day trade intraday. some swing over a few days to a week. and some just buy and hold

we dont see that context when someone is yelling a play, so dont get sucked into wanting to throw money at a green bar on your screen some one shouted

[13-Mar-21 09:24 AM] Player13#9784
so before you choose what to invest in, learn about yourself. how you like to trade/invest. 

Charlie's plays are mostly 6 month holds. if you follow them they will go up and down

figure out what speed of trading you like for yourself. that is the first step

you can trade crypto 24/7


[13-Mar-21 09:29 AM] Player13#9784
itll take time to find out what emotions move your trades. impatience? boredom? revenge after a mistake? fear of loss? fear of missing out (FOMO)? all these are valid feelings but they must be recognized and you need to work around them to be successful. 

Knowing your feelings will help guide you into knowing what time spans you like to keep positions open for. And what emotions to ignore when they swell

ive been listening to buffet since yesterday. i agree with some of his stuff that others dont say. like if you are rock solid on a long term play you should be comfortable scaling up in it


[13-Mar-21 09:33 AM] Player13#9784
he doesnt trade price action though and thats the part i disagree with


[13-Mar-21 09:34 AM] DTenrgy#4952
The only we see Mara and riot down if the market opens red Monday. Otherwise, they will hit viable 70-75 maybe

RIOT maybe, MARA not yet. unless we get knews soon that MARA is done their isntallations. then i think MARA will get more love than RIOT. but by all means play both

i was in the process of opening an accouunt with Gemini, but they couldnt validate in Canada without getting money wired to them or something. so i went with WealthSimple Crypto, which is backed by Gemini


[13-Mar-21 09:37 AM] Trance#0116
Honestly, buying at 270 could be great or if an attack happens and we get a $90 drop in 5 mins im pouncing, but MARA and Riot are looking too good RN


[13-Mar-21 09:38 AM] bcbuddy#8389
Yeah the GME downside is way too much for me


[13-Mar-21 09:38 AM] Player13#9784
is coinbase like a brokerage/wallet for crypto?
and what is Binance, cause i heard some good vibes about it


[13-Mar-21 09:38 AM] TraderAddict#9573
You think RIOT is hitting $75 on Monday?!?


[13-Mar-21 09:38 AM] Trance#0116
Binance is another place you can trade crypto


[13-Mar-21 09:38 AM] Trance#0116
And yea coinbase is a exactly what u said


[13-Mar-21 09:38 AM] Trance#0116
Binance is the same and they have there own coin

I have 200 MARA at $27.05

I have 50 RIOT at $18

Looking for suggestions from some of you experienced people. Should I unload some of it for a profit or wait for it to drive higher?


[13-Mar-21 09:40 AM] Player13#9784
this one guy that Tom Nash talks to (channel ACoupleCents) was saying that the Binance coin is like buying stock of Binance as a crypto broker

[13-Mar-21 09:41 AM] Trance#0116
Uniswap is another thing thats similar

Make a crypto brokerage account and just see the daily gainers and losers if one peaks your interest further research it üëç


[13-Mar-21 09:42 AM] bcbuddy#8389
Depends on how confident you are. If you lock some profits in you can use them to start up another play while the rest of your shares stay in the game

I typically lock a bit of profits in when everybody gets super excited but im a lot more conservative after seeing the losing end of holding for too long. 
 
Often when people are the most bullish/bearish does an unexpected move in price scare people and cause an overreaction

theoretically, yes. i dont have any experience yet, but Jimmy D makes money every week doing that play week in week out.
im trying to get out of betting on horses. i have my long term horses already. i need like a weekly 15-25% gain and spreads seem to be able to do that

how many of you set yourself up as a business? my goal is to make 4k monthly this year (consistently) is that enough to bother with doing it? sometimes I don't make that much, this month I make more than that. Basically, with a masters degree, the most I have ever made is 2k per month ever! lol so I am making more now that I am ever used to

it is equally unclear in Canada when you qualify as a business and when you dont. but i havent made enough gains to start thinkig about that

yall put money aside for taxes?


[13-Mar-21 09:53 AM] Cabela#1321

Do you guys think the BTC halving event will plummet miner companies?


[13-Mar-21 10:00 AM] TraderAddict#9573
One of my friends said  - Btc halving happens after 210.000 blocks have been mined, or roughly ever 4th year. 

This event cuts the miners returns in half. Basically it does two things

1) Btc way of small inflationary increases by controlling the amount of Btc that can be mined

2) reduces the amount of inefficient miners due to it not being profitable any longer

Good morning all. I am looking for a little help trying to figure out this fundamental analysis on ticker NPTN. I bought earlier in the week and it‚Äôs been steady climbing. I have price target at $14. I‚Äôm thinking maybe it could have more growth this year with 5G and the autonomous driving sensor technology. Looks to me like they been paying down debt pretty well and revenue has been growing every year. But earnings looks to be struggling maybe due to paying down the debt. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm missing something but really try to figure it out if it solid company to hold for a year or stick with short term to my pt. Hope that makes sense to someone smarter than me


[13-Mar-21 10:07 AM] Player13#9784

So the stimulus is coming this week, not in 2 weeks. Shouldn't this mean next week will be super green


[13-Mar-21 10:09 AM] Player13#9784
when i consider whether i would hold a play, i start looking for analysts or underwriters to explain the PE ratio of the company and of the sector. are they undervalued in terms of that ratio and have catching up to do? or are they trading with close to the expected PE and cap out at the $14 ?


[13-Mar-21 10:10 AM] zack_sherman#6750
Yea, my theory is BTC mining will be especially because you got inflation from the stimulus with the stimulus itself going into both bitcoin and the mining companies

Hello Traders,


Here is my new year gift for the community, Digergence for Many Indicators v4. I tried to make it modular and readable as much as I can. Thanks to Pine Team for improving Pine Platform all the time!

How it works?

I realized in the downturn that 60 holdings does not mean diversity. About 45 of those 60 holdings tanked

That‚Äôs difficult to know what‚Äôs going on in every position, 15 is max for many

Over lap in sectors?


[13-Mar-21 12:13 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
look at the macd and the positive/negative divergences for good entries and exits. hold on the buy trends sell on the sell offs. its pretty simple when you're using 10 indicators lol


[13-Mar-21 12:13 PM] theGreatest#3048
Long term investing, shorter term swings and day trades, 60 is a lot


[13-Mar-21 12:13 PM] Goldman Nut Sachs#8732
I think my issue is I feel if I only put $500 into this play, I can only lose $500. So, I end up doing that 60 times


[13-Mar-21 12:14 PM] theGreatest#3048
Maybe reevaluate your goals, set a plan to get there, that sounds a bit ambiguous

during a sell off its good to swing. you dont want to hold nothing if the nasdaq is still selling off lol

Maybe go through Charlie‚Äôs picks and pick a handful that are your favorites and in good deal territory, be spoiled, don‚Äôt force buying just because, focus on a handful instead of trying to get a piece of everything

Riot seems to run up with Bitcoin and then fall back fairly quickly once btc slows down. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll lock in profits early next week and then wait for riot to dip and buy back in or sell puts to get back in

Yeah, the options premium is a good way to make money, but it‚Äôs hard to get right because of how volatile it is. On its last huge dip, I sold a bunch of puts around $50 because I didn‚Äôt think it would fall that far... I ended up with a lot of riot shares


[13-Mar-21 12:44 PM] piercb216#1043

hmm. Well thats good. Im just curious how does it affect my call option. Because now it has a new ticker on RH STLA2 and it says I can only sell my position. Im guessing its not listed anymore on RH. Hoping its a temporary thing until the markey opens on Monday

[13-Mar-21 02:07 PM] Jimmy D#5438
You cant afford 100 calls of riot


[13-Mar-21 02:07 PM] CodyShields#1348
seriously though that's stupid


[13-Mar-21 02:07 PM] CodyShields#1348
just buy riot and mara stock


[13-Mar-21 02:07 PM] CodyShields#1348
and maybe a whole bitcoin if you can afford it


[13-Mar-21 02:07 PM] CodyShields#1348

@GoldenChickyum I actually plan on doing that but I may well chicken out


[13-Mar-21 02:08 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
really how much does 100 calls cost?


[13-Mar-21 02:09 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
like a dollar for 100 shares lol


[13-Mar-21 02:09 PM] jeromeo 1969#5615
You need to own 100 shares of stock to sell 1 call


[13-Mar-21 02:09 PM] booshkaboy#4467
Depends on the expiration and strike


[13-Mar-21 02:09 PM] booshkaboy#4467
The further expiration is the more expensive they will be


[13-Mar-21 02:09 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
so if i 1000 shares i can buy 10 call options


[13-Mar-21 02:10 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
have


[13-Mar-21 02:10 PM] jeromeo 1969#5615
Yes


[13-Mar-21 02:10 PM] Jimmy D#5438
You can sell 10 call options


[13-Mar-21 02:10 PM] jeromeo 1969#5615
No, sell


[13-Mar-21 02:10 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412

There's gotta be an upper limit to the share price of any miner, even with hype added on top

not too familiar i just buy stocks lol


[13-Mar-21 02:12 PM] Player13#9784
Whereas btc keeps testing new highs and gets more tight


[13-Mar-21 02:12 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
so when i sell 1 options call do i still have my 100 shares


[13-Mar-21 02:13 PM] booshkaboy#4467
No

Options Trading for Beginners (The ULTIMATE In-Depth Guide)
Options trading is a very difficult thing to learn as a beginner, as there are many moving parts and many concepts to learn simultaneously. In this video, my goal is to bring you from zero to hero in a few hours, even if you don't know anything about trading options.

We are going to explore the world of options through many examples and graphic...

so whats the point in buying calls if you need to have 100 shares in it first before you sell it? i know they are cheaper but u need 100 shares regardless?

it sounds like you are interested in selling covered calls, where you hold 100 shares and make an agreement to sell those shares under certain conditions


[13-Mar-21 02:16 PM] Stranglehold#5685

and profited with the call if it expired in the money


[13-Mar-21 02:20 PM] booshkaboy#4467
Yes you‚Äôll still have your 100 shares of riot. The contract is completely separate


[13-Mar-21 02:20 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
okay so i know riot is going to expire in the money next week

Facts


[13-Mar-21 02:21 PM] thelols#6570
You're up 10k and you think there's more room to grow. You're new to trading so you don't take profits. All of a sudden you're down 3k overall


[13-Mar-21 02:21 PM] TraderAddict#9573
If you own 100 shares you can sell 1 call against them. That means your taking a bearish stance. You don‚Äôt want your stock to increase over the set strike price. You will receive a nice premium for just selling the call, regardless of what happens. If your contract is within the money during expiration you have to sell your stocks at the agreed upon strike price. So the risk involved is potentially setting a cap on your profits.

Buying a call is buying the ability to purchase 100 shares at a preset price (strike price)

One of the biggest things I realized from watching price action on options tho is u def don‚Äôt want to chase breakouts with calls. Ur position will get crushed very quickly. If a big move happens the premiums skyrocket and if u buy the top of that it‚Äôs a whole other level of pain


[13-Mar-21 02:30 PM] booshkaboy#4467
U lose money so fast it‚Äôs crazy

see traderaddict.... they dont want us to have the good charts for crypto ... this is my point ... im leaning towards kraken being the best though


[13-Mar-21 02:45 PM] dizzolve#2009
coincidentally bitcoin slowed down here around 61,7

I would love to be able to have crypto on TOS


[13-Mar-21 02:46 PM] dizzolve#2009
I'm about to give up on TOS


[13-Mar-21 02:46 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Yea man it can be confusing trust me. I finally took the time last week to dedicate to research and looking at videos. It took sometime until one night it ‚Äúclicked‚Äù and now everyday I have built upon that knowledge. I‚Äôm dipping my toes into options with selling first before I explore buying options which is another ball game. Gotta take baby steps

if bitcoin breaks down might have support 57

[13-Mar-21 02:47 PM] Buck#2995
what do yall think for this coming week?  interest rate scare again>? or is that temporarily over????


[13-Mar-21 02:47 PM] Buck#2995
agreed... im looking for that 56 to 58 range


[13-Mar-21 02:48 PM] Stranglehold#5685
in my amateur opinion, I think the stimulus money is going to be an elevating factor, but if the bond yield shakes up investors just treat it like a good buying opportunity like a couple weeks ago


[13-Mar-21 02:49 PM] TraderAddict#9573
If I had known about covered calls during this dip I would have bought MARA and RIOT in a heartbeat! Now I‚Äôm trying to find an entry into RIOT.. FML

so in general as long as the stock price goes up from when i entered the call option its good


[13-Mar-21 02:50 PM] TraderAddict#9573
BTC at 62k?!

I only ever bought and held through volatility, but I'm up like 90%. If I could do it all over again I'd have sold all my bitcoin and bought MARA. Just me though, I held BTC just in case we saw massive inflation


[13-Mar-21 02:52 PM] CodyShields#1348
@TraderAddict dude there was Fantastic deals last week

thats not good if it goes above your strike price?

BTC looks like it needs to let off some steam


[13-Mar-21 02:53 PM] TraderAddict#9573
That means I capped my potential


[13-Mar-21 02:53 PM] CodyShields#1348
it means you have to sell the shares at that price.


[13-Mar-21 02:54 PM] CodyShields#1348
what you want is to just keep the contract money AND the stonks


[13-Mar-21 02:54 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
dang you should have put the expiration date for around the 20th-28th


[13-Mar-21 02:54 PM] CodyShields#1348
but I wouldn't dare sell contracts while it's at ATH like this


[13-Mar-21 02:54 PM] CodyShields#1348
just 1 week from a major cooloff

I wouldn't be surprised to see riot hit 80-90$ this weej

[13-Mar-21 02:57 PM] TraderAddict#9573
No dude that‚Äôs worse.. if it blows past my strike price that means my capital is tied up even longer. I‚Äôm glad it expires Friday lol. Time decay is my friend as a seller of options.


[13-Mar-21 02:57 PM] CodyShields#1348
I think this week will blow it away


[13-Mar-21 02:57 PM] CodyShields#1348
@TraderAddict he said if your stonks got sold and then the price drops hard. I hope for your sake that happens. it'll give me a chance to buy more also LoL


[13-Mar-21 02:57 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
ill buy an 80 dollar call on riot expiring on the 26th. so sell it before it hits 80 dollars? probably around 75


[13-Mar-21 02:58 PM] TraderAddict#9573
There been my luck lately lol


[13-Mar-21 02:58 PM] CodyShields#1348
@GoldenChickyum that's risky AF and you're probably going to piss your money away


[13-Mar-21 02:58 PM] CodyShields#1348
@GoldenChickyum but I guess technically it could work


[13-Mar-21 02:58 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
lol how is that risky

it's bona-fide gambling in my mind lop


[13-Mar-21 02:59 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
i would hold it cause btc is still on an uptrend right now


[13-Mar-21 02:59 PM] CodyShields#1348
selling covered calls is WAY less risky


[13-Mar-21 03:00 PM] TraderAddict#9573
I‚Äôm thinking if I buy RIOT for covered calls I‚Äôll need to at least go out 20 bucks for weeklies. That ticker can move. If it drops big I‚Äôll buy the dip and swing trade it while holding, try to bring my cost average down


[13-Mar-21 03:00 PM] CodyShields#1348
but next week or next month or eventually when bitcoin hits 20 or 30k you may be hurting real bad


[13-Mar-21 03:00 PM] TraderAddict#9573
No joke though the premium I can make doing CC‚Äôs on that bad boy will offset some loss


[13-Mar-21 03:00 PM] CodyShields#1348
@TraderAddict it will indeed. it's a huge growth potential and the margins prove it


[13-Mar-21 03:01 PM] TraderAddict#9573
The IV is so high I can play more conservative with my strike and still make decent premiums


[13-Mar-21 03:01 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
ohhh so as long as i have good entry/exit points with buying calls im good right? cause i know i'm pretty good with technicals


[13-Mar-21 03:02 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Bro..I don‚Äôt think BTC is going back to 20k lol. That‚Äôs wishful thinking


[13-Mar-21 03:02 PM] TraderAddict#9573
I‚Äôd sell my home to buy some


[13-Mar-21 03:03 PM] Stranglehold#5685
honestly bro a HELOC for BTC isn't the craziest idea I've ever heard


[13-Mar-21 03:03 PM] EddieSmurphy#9362
20k no way, maybe 20% pullback like in February, but this thing is projected to hit 100k by year end, and a lot of retail investors are buying into that projection.


[13-Mar-21 03:04 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Honestly though even if it pulled back a bit which it can.. it‚Äôs just unrealized loss.. hold through the the downturn and you will be fine if it happens during a CC.


[13-Mar-21 03:04 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Or.. just buy back the contract because it will probably be much cheaper and sell the stock and buy back at a lower price lol


[13-Mar-21 03:06 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Guys what if BTC goes to 70k and then pulls back to 50ish..we may not even see 40is anymore. It‚Äôs currently making higher highs and higher lows on the 1 year chart


[13-Mar-21 03:07 PM] Stranglehold#5685
that might just be the value of BTC now, big institutions and retail investors are all adopting


[13-Mar-21 03:08 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
lets worry about the most important thing rnow. btc is going up on the daily chart with more upside.


[13-Mar-21 03:08 PM] TraderAddict#9573
I‚Äôm probably pulling $600 weekly in premiums from covered calls right now


[13-Mar-21 03:09 PM] TraderAddict#9573
I‚Äôm not rich from it by any means but it‚Äôs usually consistent and helps pay the bills


[13-Mar-21 03:09 PM] Stranglehold#5685
thats respectable, especially since it sounds like you've got a repeatable setup


[13-Mar-21 03:09 PM] Stranglehold#5685
600 a week for 52 weeks is 31k


[13-Mar-21 03:09 PM] TraderAddict#9573

[13-Mar-21 03:12 PM] Sorto_11#8336
been doing some DD since hoping back in. Kinda let 2 weeks pass given the given market, and seeing all this info you still considering holding the stock?


[13-Mar-21 03:12 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Currently has pulled back


[13-Mar-21 03:12 PM] Sorto_11#8336
since some stocks are coming back, kinda feel I shoudl move that money elsewhere


[13-Mar-21 03:13 PM] Stranglehold#5685
In my opinion it depends on your outlook on the MJ sector as a whole, the amount of capital you have tied up, etc


[13-Mar-21 03:13 PM] Sorto_11#8336
cause the sector as a whole has been slow


[13-Mar-21 03:13 PM] Sorto_11#8336

[13-Mar-21 03:13 PM] Shohola#5097
Not necessarily. The further ITM your call is, the closer its value tracks the underlying stock's value. But the further OTM and the closer to expiration it is, the bigger swings you need in the stock's price to offset the time decay. So you could end up with a situation where the stock's price has gone up since you bought the call, but you're in the red on that call.

For me, I'm holding roughly 3% of my account in SNDL because once MJ takes off, the allure of a quick speculative play is nice. I can afford not to use  3% of my capital. Not investing advice, but you aren't doing yourself any favors if you are missing other opportunities because you are too far into SNDL

[13-Mar-21 03:17 PM] Stranglehold#5685
it sounds like you made good decisions about how much you could afford to have tied up. SNDL is a speculative play, and the prospect of federal legalization would be very bullish for MJ in general

Funny enough I just googled federal legalization and it looks like a legalization bill in congress just passed the house.

In historic vote, marijuana legalization bill passed in U.S. House
The bill passed with a simple majority, 228 to 164, with just 6 Democrats opposing it, and 5 votes approving on the GOP side, and one Independent.

Options can be great for leverage but yeah, definitely watch some videos on how before you get into them. There's also options P/L calculators that let you play around with how changes in the stock's price, passage of time, changes in IV affect the value of an option.

There are many types of SuperTrend around. Recently I thought about a Supertrend based on Pivot Points then I wrote "Pivot Point SuperTrend" script. It looks it has better performance on keeping you in the trend more.

The idea is behind this script is finding pivot point, calculating average of them and like in supertrend creating h...

how well has this worked for you?


[13-Mar-21 03:25 PM] upforwow#4766
So with all this btc uptrending, do any of you believe that people are using it as a hedge against the dollar.  If inflation gets out of hand, stocks will be running scared and bitcoin could go even higher. How do you all feel about this scenario?


[13-Mar-21 03:25 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
very good. keeps u in the trend more. lol while bears were getting trapped yesterday at 55-57k everybody was panic selling.

I personally was holding bitcoin due to fears over large amounts of inflation. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the resource, but you can't make more bitcoin like you can make more USD

[13-Mar-21 03:27 PM] Sorto_11#8336
Hopefully yes, it would be crazy though heck of ride IMO


[13-Mar-21 03:29 PM] upforwow#4766
Because BTC is worldwide, it is immune to problems of specific counties, only worldwide events, such as pandemics and wars. So if the US has a high inflation rate, BTC will outpace the dollar, hence bringing stock values lower.


[13-Mar-21 03:29 PM] Stranglehold#5685
I have 650 shares with an average buy in of 1.81. It was definitely not a perfect setup, but it would be nice to see this thing fly anywhere near Charlie's $6 price target


[13-Mar-21 03:32 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
The ultimate trend line was quite helpful. It stayed red although it had broken the line telling me there was some negative left and sure enough it kept trending down a few minutes later


[13-Mar-21 03:32 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
MACD said it was time to buy back in so very helpful


[13-Mar-21 03:34 PM] Jimmy D#5438

[13-Mar-21 03:35 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Good thing I have 120 shares of MARA.. really hope it doesn‚Äôt go over my covered call strike at $53 lol


[13-Mar-21 03:35 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Should do Mara hasn't hit the same highs it has


[13-Mar-21 03:35 PM] Jimmy D#5438
It wont, but if it does you would be doing ok

Buying MARA or RIOT when BTC sells off. Any price in over sold territory is fine


[13-Mar-21 03:45 PM] j28#9054
@Pintexx I was gonna buy under 50 but now that never gonna happen, what's the oversold price??

@Pintexx yo, what time frame are you looking at?


[13-Mar-21 03:47 PM] zack_sherman#6750
I bought into RIOT at 60, the only reason why is my assumption that monday and Tuesday will be green. Just a short holding period, if I was in it for a month long swing or longer, I‚Äôd wait till low 50s


[13-Mar-21 03:48 PM] j28#9054
I'm in on MARA, up about 30 since the dio


[13-Mar-21 03:48 PM] j28#9054

[13-Mar-21 05:52 PM] Jnardi#7967
Even if the daq does crap, and limits the run, if btc continues to pop, the minute the Nasdaq turns green it will fly. Kinda what happened this week


[13-Mar-21 05:52 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Me too! Are you biting the bullet on Monday?


[13-Mar-21 05:53 PM] Player13#9784
Yea just gotta make sure to sell for some profits so ppl can rebuy the dip. We never know how far the dip goes so it might be more profitable than waiting 1.5 months for the rebound and just sitting on a red stock


[13-Mar-21 05:54 PM] Player13#9784

Well I mean here‚Äôs what I thinküòÇ feel free to disagree I‚Äôd love to hear what other people have to say. But when you factor in the 60k+ price, the stimulus adding to inflation which will raise BTC, and many using the stimulus to bump the market up, I think those three reasons are good enough (for me) to hold through this weekend and sell out early this upcoming week


[13-Mar-21 06:09 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Well I‚Äôm buying to hold long term and do covered calls


[13-Mar-21 06:10 PM] CaneDawg#4435
I think so but but if the yield is over 1.6 will it run with btc or daq like it had been but btc has been way up this weekend.  I‚Äôm not sure but we will learn allot from Monday for future trades


[13-Mar-21 06:10 PM] zack_sherman#6750
I gotcha. I‚Äôve been considering adding it as a long term position, but I don‚Äôt know enough fundamental aspects of all of these mining companies


[13-Mar-21 06:11 PM] zack_sherman#6750
Good point, the tough one about RIOT and MARA is trying to guess what has more influence on the price. I guess the NASDAQ and overall market does judging by what happened in the past few weeks. Historically (I use that as if it happened years ago), BTC reacts positively to stimulus checks like these


[13-Mar-21 06:13 PM] CaneDawg#4435
So far but has the surge this weekend been enough to buck that trend,

[13-Mar-21 06:39 PM] DragonFruit#9932
Im not in sold at 31 which was a royal F%√ªp but dependent on how bitcoin acts, if it drops tommorrow then Mara might stay stagnant, but if bitcoin Decideds to pop into the mid 60S on monday than im thinking MARA and Riot will run, only thing that can stop them is if Monday is the BIGGEST BULL TRAP we have ever seen lol


[13-Mar-21 06:41 PM] Relyt305#5469
Is BTC still a scam??


[13-Mar-21 06:42 PM] wholeo40#1116
@Ziplg73 it looks too sexy, shes looking like she has options so it might scare people away, they will want a btc with potential but still has its flaws u know, they will want it on the dip so demand might be low rn idk


[13-Mar-21 06:42 PM] wholeo40#1116
idk i hope it goes up tho cause im invested in mara and riot


[13-Mar-21 06:43 PM] Ziplg73#3534

What‚Äôs a bull trap


[13-Mar-21 06:53 PM] ! I love tea#1563
A bull trap is a false signal, referring to a declining trend in a stock, index, or other security that reverses after a convincing rally and breaks a prior support level. The move "traps" traders or investors that acted on the buy signal and generates losses on resulting long positions.

[13-Mar-21 07:39 PM] Player13#9784
im feelin a bit bearish about the markets, since its been just a short stretch of rocky green so far


[13-Mar-21 07:42 PM] Noinimod Ma#1545
btc is honesty the only investment that I trust at the moment for myself haha. I've also got much longer term crypto goals compared to stocks so I suppose that helps a little too


[13-Mar-21 07:42 PM] ACE#9849
Does anyone know how to customize the quantity option? As we can see in picture there is a built in button for 100, 300, 500, 1k and 2k ... I just want to create similar button for 2.5k and 3k.

It being a Bear trap would depend on how deep the bounceback is. I think some people expect the rubber banding

I think, if anything, the more the market crashes, the more crypto will become valuable. Seeing as money is being printed like crazy right now too and that inflation is looking like a real possibility... people will be turning to crypto as a reprieve.

anyone think RIOT has the potential to break its ATH? I guess its possible. I just know that the company isn't actually worth what its showing. The stock at this point is just a reflection only of the hype around crypto and thats it.


[13-Mar-21 08:26 PM] Player13#9784
eventually, but we have seen some of the red weeks of Feb not do too much for BTC as a hedge

>VWAP<Middle-Regression-Line-Setup-Chart/Scanner 

Hello, for this chart/scanner setup to make sense you must understand the workings of the VWAP and Standard Deviation Channels. Ok then, the idea of this setup is to search for stocks where the price is at or above the VWAP. The price is trending up but still below the Middle Regression Line on the Standard Deviation Channels. I‚Äôm trying to catch the move that pops above the VWAP but not get too greedy and set a limit sell at the Middle Regression Line. You still will need to monitor the trade because the Middle Regression Line will move up and down depending on the trend. Good Luck. Chart- https://tos.mx/vhXWjiK Scanner- https://tos.mx/aNnJMTr

HBAR just surged 40% thats a lot for NYSE but not for crypto, i think you could easily hold onto it and make way more. i regretted selling my bullish coin especially in this bull market i dont think its smart to sell but if you really feel it, take profit

[13-Mar-21 11:01 PM] Makelele#0802
and the buy point is when EMA crosses RSI upward


[13-Mar-21 11:01 PM] Makelele#0802
this is on daily time scale

The last two days closed above the downward trend line, but it got rejected at the 50, and couldnt hold the 21 yesterday. 50/50 at this point.  May eat some time off the clock and move sideways to gather some steam to push through, or we're making another leg lower.


[13-Mar-21 11:47 PM] JUPITER#7505
thanks


[13-Mar-21 11:47 PM] Tom A#1892
Alot of charts look very encouraging. Theres something about this divergence bwtween the SPY/IWM and the QQQ that makes me nervous though.  Either the Qs will get pulled up with the rest of the market or the other two will start to rollover this week.


[13-Mar-21 11:48 PM] Th3Landl0rd#1604
QQQ broke above the downtrend line on 3/11, retested it on 3/12 and closed above it on both days.  Super bullish.  I would not want to be shorting big tech right now unless it goes below 311

WSB has taught me a lot.  Not as much as Charlie.  But there are some smart people there who put in a sh** ton of time posting info that explains a lot about the stock market.


[14-Mar-21 04:22 AM] BTFD#9631
Yes, you need to be cautious when putting money into a stock they're hyping.  But even if you're not willing to, there's a lot you can learn just from the cumulative knowledge.  You have to go to Best Of DD to find it.  But it's there.


[14-Mar-21 04:25 AM] b1331#9355
Theres still alot of dd needed to be done with wsb stocks. I see more potential in amc if the squeeze were to fail but gamestop also has potential with the new executives they brought in to innovate the company. The thing people dont understand about AMC is that its the largest movie chain in the world


[14-Mar-21 04:26 AM] BTFD#9631
I wasn't willing to put money in either of those, but made $77 on RKT after doing my own due diligence.

[14-Mar-21 04:32 AM] BTFD#9631
I guess what I'm saying is that I've learn a lot about how the market works by reading some of the "best of" posts.  Many are written to teach people about market conditions, why certain things are happening, etc.


[14-Mar-21 04:37 AM] BTFD#9631
WSB gets a bad rap. But they're worth more than their bad reputation.


[14-Mar-21 04:38 AM] Ren#8322
As long as you are avoiding market noise or understanding the sentiment of the market, if you know of upcoming catalysts you can use them to your advantage. Honestly psychological trading is a more realistic approach to trading. Technicals mean almost nothing when it's supply vs demand. All they do is add positive indications / lower risk indications


[14-Mar-21 04:39 AM] Ren#8322
I'm sitting in on acic sub 11$. When the nasdaq recovers this stock will recover in suit, if nasdaq crashes i lose no money. I'm expecting a runup to around 17$ on this recovery for acic over a week or 2

Like Ether is probably the best in my opinion as it's blockchains are found from helping applications whereas BTC is through transactions of selling/buying BTC.

BTC itself has no real value beyond what the people think it's worth but so does art, pokemon cards and money.

ive been all about MJ retail, but i am more and more seeing that as a legit reopening play, since they have been impacted by covid. Both the companies im in have gained profitability despite the pandemic and lockdowns. 
Really excited to increase my stake in Planet13 though with them opening a store in Cali in the summer. This should double all their numbers. Cannabis tourism is something im getting hyped about

Bill Ackman Just Shorted The Stock Market AGAIN!
In this video we will be looking into why Bill Ackman is once again shorting the stock market once again, just like this time last year. Are his fears warranted? Do you think we will get another market correction?

its easy for him to short the markets as a hedge. like the video said, if he's wrong, it's a fixed cost and helps insure against a dunk
for inflation to take hold that shouold be delayed after the reopening has caused that surge in spending being predicted. so that means 1) we have to get to reopening 2) we have to see people feeling comfortable traveling and spending and 3) once all those things happen we have to see people actually being ok with spending more on XYZ instead of waiting (which is the feds theory on what could prevent inflation from sticking around long)

so, as inflation rises, we could see a dip then.  Then whether that dip persists and spirals into a doomsday crash, that depends on whether or not people cant wait for the things they want to spend money on.

yeah you are completely right there is a lot of variables to this and im not buying into complete doomsday personally. But it could be a good idea to take a small hedge against the market soon im trying to determine my best course of action right now. There is a lot of things stacking against us imo at the moment and im thinking taking a hedge position on the overall market or my most high conviction stocks maybe when we get to resistance on the s&p could be a good insurance policy we should all consider worst case we lose maybe $850 in premiums per 100 shares best case could keep portfolios in the negative 5-15% range instead of substantially more.

Is bitcoin a proper hedge against  a major inflationary period? I mean, I‚Äôve watched a few videos on how we are setting ourselves up for a pretty significant problem. How probable is that to actually happen? Or is there really no way of saying if it will or


[14-Mar-21 10:25 AM] gurto#1965
ive heard some good theories about how btc even if it isnt a hedge against inflation soo many people see it as one know that it could be a self fulfilling prophecy. but im not a crypto guy so really i have no idea üòÇ


[14-Mar-21 10:28 AM] Player13#9784
as a short term hedge i dont think so because ive seen it dip with the markets. 

but considering that it will get more scarce as the years go on, that by its very nature will cause it to increase in value. insurance companies and payment processors wouldnt put money into BTC if they didnt see it that way as well

i typed in over 40 popular stocks everyone is talking abt. if it pops up on the oversold chart ill take a deeper look into the technical indicators to determine if i want to make a position. most likely if a stock is overbought its probably a good reason its overbought. (btc and btc stocks) right now. Like American Airlines is on my overbought list but its not done running up either

[14-Mar-21 12:41 PM] dogg#3367
Personally I would wait it out on RIDE. They just got alot of bad press and yes the stock is discounted rn but its possible it can keep going down. CLOV dropped just like RIDE when they had a similar report come out last month, and CLOV looked like a steal but proceeded to keep dropping about 50% more over the next few weeks. It's just now barely starting to recover. RIDE also kinda looks iffy if theres any truth about the short seller report so personally I'm staying away for a while see how it plays out. But of course do you own DD and see what the right decision is for you

I wonder how RIOT and MARA would react if BTC kept rising to 70k range. I‚Äôd like to assume it would do very well but I think I said yesterday in the chat after following the recent correction, it‚Äôs hard to tell if those plays are more correlated with bitcoin or the overall market sentiment

Yeah it def is hard to say how itll go. It hit a bottom around 14 I believe and stayed a in the $14 to $15 range on Friday but its probably just a bull trap and itll keep going down eventually. Puts might not be a bad idea

It's pretty much a sinkhole until they fill the sinkhole.


[14-Mar-21 01:05 PM] dizzolve#2009
and I wasn't keen on their taking their sweet time to announce the actual merge.   While we all waited for the announcement the price kept blowing up.   As soon as they had a big big red day they got their act together and announced.  I started to feel fish hooked lol


[14-Mar-21 01:06 PM] dizzolve#2009
then once announced, the valuation was WAY off reports


[14-Mar-21 01:06 PM] philm4#3214
yeah, with speculation plays like this are always worth minimal investment and take profit plays


[14-Mar-21 01:06 PM] dizzolve#2009
which led to the meltdown


[14-Mar-21 01:07 PM] philm4#3214
Well I'd advise to watch what feds do this wed


[14-Mar-21 01:07 PM] philm4#3214
If they reduce the repurchasing of treasuries. We'll probably see % points go up like crazy


[14-Mar-21 01:08 PM] philm4#3214
If that happens, it might be another 2013 situation the last time they announced that


[14-Mar-21 01:08 PM] dizzolve#2009
I wouldn't mind seeing a pullback in something worth buying dip on.   If a stim check is coming


[14-Mar-21 01:09 PM] philm4#3214
Oh yeah except this pullback, if it happens like last time, volatility lasted about 8 weeks üòÆ


[14-Mar-21 01:09 PM] Player13#9784
i get the feeling a pullback will come after the stims are spent, like next week


[14-Mar-21 01:09 PM] Player13#9784
oh dang


[14-Mar-21 01:09 PM] philm4#3214
Interest rates went up about 80%


[14-Mar-21 01:09 PM] philm4#3214
when they announced reduction in repurchasing


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] Player13#9784
volatility or pullback for 8 weeks


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] philm4#3214
volatility


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] philm4#3214
not necessarily pullback


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] philm4#3214
but right now VIX


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] philm4#3214
is looking to either bounce off the 20 line


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] Player13#9784
vix about to hit bottom support at 20


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] remlapj#5234
Make selling calls more interesting


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] philm4#3214
with upside 30


[14-Mar-21 01:10 PM] philm4#3214
or downside 15 then 12ish - 10ish


[14-Mar-21 01:11 PM] Player13#9784
i cashed out my margin account friday (it was all GME)
and i plan on cashing out STPK as soon as it goes up a bit more. it just hit break even at 35 when i was holding it down from 25


[14-Mar-21 01:12 PM] philm4#3214
Lmao you still had GME?


[14-Mar-21 01:12 PM] philm4#3214
Well at least you caught the second run


[14-Mar-21 01:12 PM] philm4#3214
nice bro


[14-Mar-21 01:12 PM] zack_sherman#6750
Do you think this will create volatility on Monday and Tuesday?


[14-Mar-21 01:12 PM] Player13#9784
i have 3 in my roth bought at 150 which ill sell when it moons


[14-Mar-21 01:13 PM] Player13#9784
the other GME was just some day trading. gonna wait for a sick azz short attack and buy some more


[14-Mar-21 01:13 PM] zack_sherman#6750
Regarding what you said about the Fed talking on Wednesday deciding what to do


[14-Mar-21 01:14 PM] philm4#3214
Hard to say. I think the market's in a wonky place right now. We're at the cusp of a massive bull run until fall/winter or another pull back for a few weeks.


[14-Mar-21 01:14 PM] philm4#3214
We just need the fed to give confidence


[14-Mar-21 01:14 PM] philm4#3214
Thats all we need


[14-Mar-21 01:15 PM] philm4#3214
Just say they'll make sure everythings gonna be okay


[14-Mar-21 01:15 PM] philm4#3214
and take care of us


[14-Mar-21 01:15 PM] philm4#3214

@GoldenChickyum the tradingview things you sent are really good.


[14-Mar-21 01:21 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Looking at them, lining them up it all pretty much agreed things had to chill on BTC


[14-Mar-21 01:22 PM] zack_sherman#6750

[14-Mar-21 01:25 PM] philm4#3214
Lol well last time some of the republicans started throwing numbers, and dismal reports at the fed chair like he knew specifics off the top of his head. Tbh congress turned that whole thing into a political agenda which kinda sucked. The whole point of him reporting was to give a general overview of what was going to happen and what they might have been looking into doing moving forward, not give specifics to cause mass hysteria.


[14-Mar-21 01:25 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412

[14-Mar-21 01:30 PM] zack_sherman#6750
I bought BTC at 6k with all the money I had when I was still in high school and I sold when it hit 18k because I thought there would be a pullback like there was in 2017. Kinda regretting that now


[14-Mar-21 01:30 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Is there some news on mara


[14-Mar-21 01:31 PM] Player13#9784
i would hate to see mara or riot run a ton in the 3 houors of pm before i can touch it at 7


[14-Mar-21 01:31 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
last I seen no one cared they had miners installed


[14-Mar-21 01:31 PM] Player13#9784
other than btc running, no, but they are going to announce their miners completing installation at some point


[14-Mar-21 01:31 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
They already announced


[14-Mar-21 01:31 PM] Player13#9784
didnt they just announce they were in the process of installing


[14-Mar-21 01:31 PM] TexMex#1337
Free chat we are talking about the fed speaking Wednesday


[14-Mar-21 01:31 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Yeah they have started installing the first batch


[14-Mar-21 01:32 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Which will put them above riot by EOM


[14-Mar-21 01:32 PM] TexMex#1337
Figure Monday will be green. Tuesday sideways. Wednesday tank. Thursday small recovery. Friday look for a day trade runner


[14-Mar-21 01:32 PM] Player13#9784
itll run after they say those miners are up and running. mining betters seem to be very in the present

[14-Mar-21 01:34 PM] Player13#9784
this is why i dont hold mara over weekends anymore


[14-Mar-21 01:34 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Cooling off a little


[14-Mar-21 01:35 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
I can't really say how much, it's fighting on the 15 atm


[14-Mar-21 01:35 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Could open at say 58k but because it's technically down you'd  see riot and mara  tank


[14-Mar-21 01:36 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Which has happened in the past with the mining stocks


[14-Mar-21 01:36 PM] Player13#9784

you should check out lazy bears squeeze momentum indicator #1 indicator on tview


[14-Mar-21 01:37 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
video on yt of how to use it too


[14-Mar-21 01:38 PM] dizzolve#2009
if it drops much under the previous ATH ...... which was........ 58.367 it might consolidate before another push up .......... but I think maybe we just need regular market hours players to add to this push.   Be interesting to see what Monday holds


[14-Mar-21 01:38 PM] Ziplg73#3534
Looks like just a minor dip before another jump to me


[14-Mar-21 01:39 PM] Mandinka#4361
Yeah, that's my concern. I sold on Friday because I didn't want to hold it for the weekend...


[14-Mar-21 01:39 PM] Ziplg73#3534
Prolly more ATH overnight if you ask me. But I also don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about and am bullish on everything


[14-Mar-21 01:39 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
I'll have a look mate


[14-Mar-21 01:41 PM] Ziplg73#3534

this run can often be in the different direction over the weekend. its nuts


[14-Mar-21 01:43 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Yeah no at the minute on the 1hr it's a no from me dog


[14-Mar-21 01:44 PM] Ziplg73#3534

i like that quote as much as anyone. but there are a lot of different trading styles too. scalping requires twitchiness. gotta pull the trigger when you see it


[14-Mar-21 01:47 PM] Ziplg73#3534
So to be clear not looking for a buy point but looking at a few time frames I like what I‚Äôm seeing for a run tonight


[14-Mar-21 01:48 PM] zack_sherman#6750
I‚Äôm in on RIOT. I hope there‚Äôs no downtrend next week, I might get into MARA though if there is a dip


[14-Mar-21 01:48 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
Yeah I'm looking at multiple so on the 1 and 5 looks good but 15 and 1 hour not so much


[14-Mar-21 01:49 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
On the 4 everything is good


[14-Mar-21 01:49 PM] TheLost_Scotsman#2950
You weight up the pros and cons. Is what I'm seeing on the 1 and 5 a fake out. Do you wait till the 15

shiet we here talkin about miners and StockMoe shouting out MARA


[14-Mar-21 01:50 PM] Player13#9784
have to buy now


[14-Mar-21 01:50 PM] Ziplg73#3534
Bc it looks like a bounce off the 180 to me. Not saying it‚Äôs a buy point but a positive sign?


[14-Mar-21 01:54 PM] TraderAddict#9573
On the 180/4 hour chart MARa is showing price weakness.  It‚Äôs about to test the 9 SMA and MACD looks like it may crossover.. RSI is slightly above fair value.. at this point there is more downward risk than upward. I may need to sell and lock in profits Monday if it continues it‚Äôs current path.

no its just too much volatility to matter i think.  If the nasdaq has a half way decent day then the Crypto plays should do great just based off the correlation with BTC i think


[14-Mar-21 02:01 PM] Ryukk#6455

i wish TORONTO DOMINION bank would actually make things for us Canadians easier, iunno, like maybe giving us a good trading app in Canada??
i hate that Ameritrade is technically a separate entity than the rest of the TD business


[14-Mar-21 02:07 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
sos looks like itll pop off soon. its squeezing with low volatility right now. https://www.tradingview.com/x/VclVW6od/

" oh neat, that's a TD platform. I bank with TD"

[14-Mar-21 02:09 PM] Player13#9784
hmm maybe i should day trade SOS instead of MARA. what more could happen? ANOTHER short report lmao


[14-Mar-21 02:09 PM] Ryukk#6455
yeah fortunately the short report effect is still giving us a buying window opportunity


[14-Mar-21 02:09 PM] Player13#9784
chance of it going up 30% + is higher than MARA


[14-Mar-21 02:10 PM] Player13#9784
i just want to yoink off a run


[14-Mar-21 02:10 PM] Ryukk#6455
if you do buy atleast 100


[14-Mar-21 02:10 PM] Player13#9784
and unfortunately the Canadian miners dont have the eyeballs and volume that nasdaq miners do


[14-Mar-21 02:11 PM] Ryukk#6455
the weekly $8 strike is providing 8% return with $55 premium


[14-Mar-21 02:11 PM] Ryukk#6455
55/663 = 8.2%


[14-Mar-21 02:12 PM] Ryukk#6455
if you were assigned youd profit 29%


[14-Mar-21 02:12 PM] Player13#9784
i would but im not interested in holding them


[14-Mar-21 02:12 PM] Player13#9784
i need that little bit of capital to learn to trade SPY spreads


[14-Mar-21 02:13 PM] Ryukk#6455
8.00-6.63 = 1.37 + 0.55 (premium) = 1.92 profit per stock = 29%


[14-Mar-21 02:13 PM] Ryukk#6455
understandable


[14-Mar-21 02:13 PM] Ryukk#6455
I just want to keep it for the weekly returns im two weeks away from paying off my initital investment of SOS


[14-Mar-21 02:13 PM] Player13#9784
if i am gonna hold itd be mara this year, and that Cipher spac


[14-Mar-21 02:14 PM] Player13#9784
after that


[14-Mar-21 02:15 PM] Player13#9784
GWAC


[14-Mar-21 02:15 PM] Ryukk#6455
after two weeks itll be fully paid off and the premiums will be free money


[14-Mar-21 02:15 PM] Player13#9784
oh neat


[14-Mar-21 02:15 PM] Player13#9784
man covered calls are crazy smart


[14-Mar-21 02:16 PM] Player13#9784
all options stuff really


[14-Mar-21 02:16 PM] Player13#9784
its like cheating but all it takes is a ton more effort


[14-Mar-21 02:16 PM] Ryukk#6455
I primarily do covered calls


[14-Mar-21 02:16 PM] Ryukk#6455
but I have played with short term expiring options but with very minimal capital


[14-Mar-21 02:17 PM] Player13#9784
if my baby stocks hit nasdaq uplisting, ill def do covered calls


[14-Mar-21 02:17 PM] Ryukk#6455
recently I bought calls expiring next friday for sens and ttoo


[14-Mar-21 02:18 PM] Player13#9784
how long did it take to learn options


[14-Mar-21 02:18 PM] Ryukk#6455
hmmm maybe a few days


[14-Mar-21 02:18 PM] Ryukk#6455
but to get comfortable with them around 2-3 months


[14-Mar-21 02:18 PM] JEbanks#0462
Does sos directly follow Bitcoin


[14-Mar-21 02:18 PM] TraderAddict#9573
Do you think it could drop to $2 bucks again?


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] Player13#9784
none of the miners do


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] Ryukk#6455
SOS is correlated to BC but due to the short report it hasnt been appreciating compared to RIOT/MARA


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] Player13#9784
if you want a ticker that follows BTC then you can buy BTC etfs


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] Player13#9784
there are 2 in canada


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] Ryukk#6455
what stock?


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] TraderAddict#9573
What did the short report say? Was it valid?


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] TraderAddict#9573
SOS


[14-Mar-21 02:19 PM] Player13#9784
applications are coming in for american BTC etfs i heard


[14-Mar-21 02:20 PM] Ryukk#6455
its a penny stock correlated to BTC so if BTC tanks it could happen but Im bullish BTC


[14-Mar-21 02:20 PM] Ryukk#6455
I dont see SOS dropping below $5


[14-Mar-21 02:21 PM] Ziplg73#3534
Why would sos drop


[14-Mar-21 02:21 PM] JEbanks#0462
Yes I was looking at which stocks to maybe do a swing with Bitcoin hitting new highs


[14-Mar-21 02:21 PM] Player13#9784
at the end of the day, SOS will suffer from the same problem all 2ndary miners have. theyre not the biggest miner of the day

Its like choosing an alt coin over BTC

so buying them you have to konw going in that youre doing it as a short-medium term play if not just swinging


[14-Mar-21 02:21 PM] Ryukk#6455
short report was stating that SOS was a fraudulent shell company that didnt exist

{Reactions}
üò¨ 

[14-Mar-21 02:22 PM] Ryukk#6455
SOS currently has 5k miners , with plans of getting 10k more miners operating by EOM


[14-Mar-21 02:22 PM] Ziplg73#3534
Haven‚Äôt they pretty much dispelled those concerns?


[14-Mar-21 02:22 PM] Ziplg73#3534
They aren‚Äôt brand new and have done other things before mining btc with blockchain and such


[14-Mar-21 02:23 PM] Ryukk#6455
I believe Riot has around 12.5k operational rigs atm


[14-Mar-21 02:23 PM] Player13#9784
hey man, i didnt like SOS at first but theyve shown their bottom support def


[14-Mar-21 02:23 PM] Player13#9784
MARA gonna blow them out eom tho


[14-Mar-21 02:24 PM] TraderAddict#9573
So you‚Äôre saying RIOT has a little over half more than SOS but the price discrepancy is that large?


[14-Mar-21 02:24 PM] Ryukk#6455
taking %potential into consideration and future growth I still see SOS as the winner but they carry more risk

{Reactions}
üöÄ 

[14-Mar-21 02:24 PM] Ryukk#6455
compared to MARA and RIOT


[14-Mar-21 02:24 PM] Mandinka#4361
4am Eastern ? How ?
They don't open for trading until 7am, at least according to their site they don't.


[14-Mar-21 02:24 PM] Ryukk#6455
so youre playing with fire but thats the risk you take; minimized risk if you DD them and have conviction in the stock


[14-Mar-21 02:25 PM] Player13#9784
sos over MARA? over the next few weeks or what time frame


[14-Mar-21 02:25 PM] Ziplg73#3534
@Player13 growth wise it has a lot more room to run


[14-Mar-21 02:25 PM] Ryukk#6455
over the long term.... I think SOS catches up to MARA and RIOT; that being said itll be a bumpy ride


[14-Mar-21 02:26 PM] Player13#9784
what i would be afraid to bet against is market sentiment


[14-Mar-21 02:26 PM] Ziplg73#3534
It didn‚Äôt get the same bounce as the others from the btc run this week


[14-Mar-21 02:26 PM] Ryukk#6455
mara and riot were once showing similar activity to SOS middle/end of last year


[14-Mar-21 02:26 PM] Ryukk#6455
due to short reports


[14-Mar-21 02:27 PM] Player13#9784
they are 
-a chinese miner 
-have short report hate


[14-Mar-21 02:27 PM] Player13#9784
i see


[14-Mar-21 02:27 PM] Player13#9784
so youre playing the long game


[14-Mar-21 02:27 PM] Ryukk#6455
yeah but I have exposure to RIOT and SOS


[14-Mar-21 02:27 PM] Player13#9784
hmm


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Ryukk#6455
one established miner with no current concerns and a miner with short term concerns that I believe is undervalued


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Player13#9784
makes sense


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Buy_Low_Sell_High#1989
SOS has had a lot of trouble getting through that $9.00 level.  Needs to break 7.2 for me to be interested.


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Player13#9784
i feel like mara is about to overtake riot shortly


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Player13#9784
riot is the current hashrate winner but thats due to change in the next few weeks


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Player13#9784
and over the rest of the year i believe?


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Player13#9784
havent updated my stats recently


[14-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Ryukk#6455
I did read that mara is planning to expand soon getting more rigs


[14-Mar-21 02:29 PM] Player13#9784
yeah mara received the miners, have some installed and will have em all by EOM


[14-Mar-21 02:29 PM] Ryukk#6455
but if I was to play MARA it would be strictly to swing


[14-Mar-21 02:29 PM] Player13#9784
thatll give it a run up


[14-Mar-21 02:29 PM] Ryukk#6455
I dont want anymore exposure to BTC than I currently have


[14-Mar-21 02:29 PM] Player13#9784
fair


[14-Mar-21 02:29 PM] Player13#9784
my concern is whether RIOT would dip when MARAs hashrate runs past it


[14-Mar-21 02:30 PM] Player13#9784
people bet on miners literally like they bet on horses. biggst strongest fastest stats


[14-Mar-21 02:30 PM] Ryukk#6455

The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth ...
Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.

[14-Mar-21 02:32 PM] Ryukk#6455
Idgaf about short reports tbh


[14-Mar-21 02:32 PM] CaneDawg#4435
Rather have 10 shares of riot the. 100 of sos


[14-Mar-21 02:32 PM] Ryukk#6455
I actually look for them to find buying opportunities


[14-Mar-21 02:32 PM] Ryukk#6455
bought RIDE last friday


[14-Mar-21 02:33 PM] Player13#9784
RYUKs play is different. he pays down his entry cost with covered calls till all the upside is free


[14-Mar-21 02:33 PM] Player13#9784
that makes any stocks a gravy train


[14-Mar-21 02:33 PM] Player13#9784
as long as it can grow


[14-Mar-21 02:33 PM] Ryukk#6455

i need my initial capital investment to grow up. ive put a ton into retail MJ cause i see it as a hype sector with visible growth and profit on their balance sheets. 

And lately ive been noticing signs of it being also a recovery sector play as well


[14-Mar-21 02:35 PM] Ryukk#6455
look into putting a little into ZOM


[14-Mar-21 02:35 PM] Ryukk#6455

[14-Mar-21 02:35 PM] newbietrader#2526
I bought it too! I don‚Äôt know if it was the right decision. Did you read the short report ?


[14-Mar-21 02:36 PM] Ryukk#6455
yup I dont like it, similar to how I bought SKLZ when short report came out


[14-Mar-21 02:36 PM] Player13#9784
i think if you're going to play a shorted stock you need to do more research than average


[14-Mar-21 02:36 PM] Player13#9784
unless you're paying down your entry


[14-Mar-21 02:36 PM] Player13#9784
but most people arent

I want a TSLA / NIO short report

[14-Mar-21 02:40 PM] Player13#9784
so long as it dips, and the speed to dippage is instantaneous regardless of truth

But. if the markets go red they will dip again

[14-Mar-21 02:42 PM] Ryukk#6455
HUGE if


[14-Mar-21 02:43 PM] Ryukk#6455
but that would drag the whole market down not just PLTR


[14-Mar-21 02:43 PM] Player13#9784

I see alot of reputable folks in chat at the moment.  Does anyone else see a potential breakdown of QQQ at the 21 day, 50 day, or breakdown candle high, timed perfectly with the potential SPY and IWM overextended pullback or rollover?  Not saying its going to happen, but it seems the potential is still there for another leg lower.  On the flip side, the IWM and SPY could successfully test new support and QQQ continue the rally getting pulled up with the others.  The divergence has got me a bit concerned.  What are your thoughts?

[14-Mar-21 03:23 PM] GoldenChickyum#2412
overbought if it croses above 0.8. oversold if it crosses below 0.2. If its a straight line at 1.00. its still on the uptrend. if a smooth straight line at 0. its still on the downtrend

I've got a question. Call me stupid if you  must.  The fed says everything is A-OK. No concern with inflation, but the bond yeild goes up anyway causing stock prices to fall.  Who decided to raise bond yeilds or how is it decided? Thx


[14-Mar-21 03:24 PM] Noinimod Ma#1545
nope. I've got a spare set of cash incase it has another dip before rocking this week

I see I'd probably be a bit patient with it and wait on positive movement over .2. Just because it 0 doesn't mean I'd want to buy it unless something else gave me more confidence

https://www.tradingview.com/x/gWnSIYVX/ see how it dipped to 0 again on march the 7th. the macd also just crossed over with a bullish order block and 4 positive divergences during a buy trend. You couldn't say it wasnt a steal lol

i dont have the history analyzing the QQQ but ill learn what i can parroting others. FX Evolution thinks that the increased volume on thursday and Friday is a good sign that institusions are holdng over the weekend.

he sees supoort at that 310 area and resistance at 324. if we break through 324 it could be a bull run for that stretch. after that run whether 324 becomes support will be a whole new story once again

Found this Reddit thread on RIDE, which is a nice counter to Hindenburg hit piece.  I‚Äôll be honest, I bought Friday in the $14s but this thing has risk and potential immense upside.  Not sure I trust Burns either, had had a dubious past w several failed companies.  Hoping @ZipCharlie addresses:

My day is made btw. Just saw my first unprompted non-trolling mention of HITIF today in main square and I am geeked

They are currently top mentions on r/pennystocks, which is no small deal for that subreddit.

[14-Mar-21 03:58 PM] Otisraven#3389
not sure still studying these trends.


[14-Mar-21 04:04 PM] Player13#9784
My short answer is no. I think that  works in favor of us continuing to enjoy a discounted price

Here is a snapshot of his answer last week

Keep in mind last month that the Planet13 Ceo said that it ain't happening till federal legalization changes that would allow them to uplist,  which I don't know why that would be different for hitif. Not sure why raj didn't mention that when he does mention that regarding opening stores in the US

Main upcoming catalysts are the ER next month for their Q1 2021 . It will include stats from the 2 recent mergers and debts being paid down and we should see an appreciable price increase from that

[14-Mar-21 04:09 PM] Player13#9784
There's no rule of thumb I don't think. It's an example of hype going elsewhere or people selling for profits. I think it's something you'd have to track on like a 4hr or 1day candle and see what the RSI and MACD tells you, see how oversold the sentiment gets to find an entry, keeping in mind overall market direction too


[14-Mar-21 04:09 PM] Otisraven#3389
not all look at DKNG, depends on the SPAC and if they actually have revenues. Watching UMCM way undervalued. high short interest.
